![](C:\Users\DELL\FLATIRON_LEARN\Project_MS_Studio\README_imges\Vaccine_tweet.png)

Currently we know COVID-19 continues to be a global crisis, there is one way to get out of the pandemic completely and that is Vaccination. The sentiment towards the vaccine has always been a mixed one as there always is a theory why one should have it and there is another which says not to have.  

Just for a basic understanding A **vaccine** works by training the **immune** system to recognize and combat pathogens, either **viruses or bacteria**. The **sentiment** towards having vaccine has been always a mixed and Vaccine sentiment has too not dramatically changed. The tweeting community has become a strong one but is no different when it comes to the sentiment and the feel is that the tweeting community can play a great role in changing but the question is are they doing enough ?

**The goal here is to do sentiment analysis in the tweet community and conclude on how the community can further improve in shifting the sentiment**
